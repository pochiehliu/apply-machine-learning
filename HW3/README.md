0. task 1 : done after peter review 
1. task 2: just realized have to? add penalty term and do grid search for logistic regression (task 2), we can identity important features for logistic regression
2. task 3: in piazza, a TA mentioned smoothing Target encoding, have to check how it works. also, penalty term
3. task 4: smooth target encoding, svm with panalty term, different pruning in decision tree, add random forest, boosting
4. task 5: extract from logistic regression/SVM with L1 penalty, decision tree, random forest, boosting (find most common important features, sort of voting results)
5. task 6: maybe the most simple one? logisticSVM + L1 or simple decision tree
