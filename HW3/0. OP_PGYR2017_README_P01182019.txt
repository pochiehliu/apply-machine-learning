1. Program Year 2017 Data Files 

This data set includes records submitted for the 2017 program year that have been matched with total confidence to a particular covered recipient (i.e., physician or teaching hospital) and displays information about that recipient. This data set includes the most recent attested-to data for Program Year 2017 as of December 31, 2018.
The data set contained in the comma-separated value (CSV) file includes only the data that is eligible for publication. Consult the Open Payments Methodology and Data Dictionary Document for an explanation of the criteria that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) used to determine what data to publish. This document can be found on the Resources page of the Open Payments website (https://www.cms.gov/OpenPayments/About/Resources.html). The Methodology and Data Dictionary Document also includes information on the data collection and reporting methodology, data fields included in the files, and any notes or special considerations that users should be aware of.
Each record in the General Payment, Research Payment, and Ownership/Investment files includes a Change Type indicator field. The Change Type value of NEW indicates that the record is newly reported by the reporting entity since the last publication and is being published for the first time. The Change Type value of ADD indicates that the record is not new in the system but, due to the record not being eligible for publication until the current publication cycle, is being published for the first time. The Change Type value of CHANGED indicates that the record was previously published but has been modified since its last publication. A record whose only change since the last publication is a change to its dispute status is categorized as a changed record. The Change Type value of UNCHANGED indicates that the record was published during the last publication cycle and is being republished without change in the current publication. 
Each record in the Removed and Deleted Records file includes a Change Type indicator field as well. The Change Type value of DELETED indicates the previously published record was deleted from the Open Payments system by the reporting entity. The Change Type value of REMOVED indicates that the previously published record was removed from the current publication as a result of the reporting entity making updates to the record which made the record ineligible for publication.
2. Considerations for using the CSV Files 

Microsoft Excel removes leading zeroes from data fields in CSV files. Certain fields in these data sets may have leading zeroes. These zeroes will be missing when viewing the information within Microsoft Excel. 

Additionally, the latest versions of Microsoft Excel cannot display data sets with more than 1,048,576 rows. Some of these CSV files may exceed that limit. Displaying the data in its entirety may require the use of spreadsheet programs capable of handling very large numbers of records.

3. Details about the Datasets Included in this OP_DTL_PGYR2017_P01182019.zip file

This compressed (.zip) file contains four (4) comma-separated values (CSV) files that use commas as delimiters and one (1) README.txt file. Descriptions of each file contained in this compressed (.zip) file are provided below.

File #1 - OP_DTL_GNRL_PGYR2017_P01182019.csv: 
This file contains the data set of General Payments reported for the 2017 program year. General Payments are defined as payments or other transfers of value made to a covered recipient (physician or teaching hospital) that are not made in connection with a research agreement or research protocol. 

File #2 - OP_DTL_RSRCH_PGYR2017_P01182019.csv:
This file contains the data set of Research Payments reported for the 2017 program year. Research Payments are defined as payments or other transfers of value made in connection with a research agreement or research protocol.

File #3 - OP_DTL_OWNRSHP_PGYR2017_P01182019.csv:
This file contains the data set of Ownership and Investment Interest Information reported for the 2017 program year. Ownership and Investment Interest Information is defined as information on the value of ownership or investment interests that a physician or an immediate family member of a physician held in an applicable manufacturer or applicable group purchasing organization (GPO).  

File #4 - OP_REMOVED_DELETED_PGYR2017_P01182019.csv:
This file contains the data set of records that were published in a previous publication of the program year data but have been deleted or removed from the current publication. Deleted records refer to records that were published in the last publication and have since been deleted by the applicable manufacturer or applicable GPO. Removed records refer to records that were published in the last publication and have since become ineligible for publication. Ineligible records may include records that were previously published and have since been edited by an applicable manufacturer or applicable GPO without re-attestation. It may also include records that were previously published and the applicable manufacturer or applicable GPO requested a delay in publication. The only identifying information provided for records in this file is the "Open Payments Record ID." This ID number allows applicable manufacturers and applicable GPOs to confirm that deleted or removed records are no longer available for publication.

Also available is a supplementary file that displays information for physicians including principal investigators indicated as recipients of payments. This supplementary file can be found in a separate zip file: 

OP_PH_PRFL_SPLMTL_P01182019.zip:
The physician profile information included in the data sets is submitted by the reporting entity. In contrast, the physician information included in the supplementary file can be derived from different sources including the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES) and the Provider Enrollment, Chain and Ownership System (PECOS). As a result, the data in these sources may differ slightly. When searching for physicians using the Open Payments search tool on https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov, use the physician profile information as listed in the supplementary file.
