"""
    Write a test that reads input.txt as provided in your repository using 
    pandas. Itâ€™s countries population from 1980 to 2010. Test that the number 
    of rows in the data is 225 and the number of columns is 31 (using the 
    country as an index). Given the correct options this file will parse 
    without changes. Write a separate test that tests that the world 
    population according to this table in 2010 is ca. 7065 million.
